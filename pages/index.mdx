## Aditi De

Hey! I am an electrical engineer who is passionate about various topics such as finance, productivity, coding, web3, and more. In addition, I have been actively researching electric vehicles and the charging infrastructure since my university days, and I am always excited to learn more about this rapidly evolving field. 

Currently, I am sharing my knowledge and insights through my [newsletter](aditide.substack.com), where I discuss various topics that interest me.

In my free time, I enjoy expressing myself through painting. This hobby provides a wonderful balance to my technical work and helps me to relax and unwind.

I am always open to connecting with like-minded individuals, so feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/byaditide) or [LinkedIn](https:/linkedin.com/in/aditide) or [Email](mailto:aditide@outlook.com).
